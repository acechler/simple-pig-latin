```js
//  The goal of this exercise will be to append 'ay' to the end of each word.
//  The first letter will have to go before 'ay'.
//
//  The best way to do this is to treat this like a queue or stack. 
//  Maybe pop out the character and push it back in. 
//
//  I will need to determine how to split all this.
//  I may need to parse through the word. That will be what I do first.
//  I will have to research some javascript utilities for any easier way.
//
//  Another issue down the line will be to keep punctuation marks safe.
//  I may need a parser after all
//
//  Gameplan
//
//  I will create a switch statement to handle how to proceed with encounters.
//  
//  I will need to put some thought into this.
